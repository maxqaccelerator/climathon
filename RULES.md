## Hack Rules
- Teams can be anywhere from two to five members. Remember, hacking with others is more fun!
- All teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the #Climathon.
- Use of open data and open-source libraries is mandatory. If you own a private dataset, please open it up!
- There will be no alcohol served or allowed on site. Zero tolerance.
- Just like Star Trek, we celebrate our differences. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. So harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.
- Consideration is golden. Please be mindful of others in the space. Our hosts at [Lighthouse Labs] may still be at their private coworking desks in the other side of the space. 
- Send out positive energy. Be a Jedi not a Sith. (not that there's anything wrong with being a Sith)

## Rules for Lighthouse Labs
- All the CO2 measurements from https://co2.jpl.nasa.gov are available in room 5Pin next to the entrance. Please connect to our special anonymous ftp server (ftp://data.wenzowski.com or ftp://192.168.1.2) using the provided cables in 5Pin instead of downloading directly from NASA.
- We’re always happy to help you find a live internet wall jack. Are you uploading a huge file, or downloading a terabyte of data? Consider not using the wifi. A staff member will be happy to help you find an ethernet cable and live wall jack to plug in to.
- We would appreciate it if you keep your phones connected to cellular data, and only add you laptops to the wifi network.
- Clean up spills immediately. The floors in this space are very porous. Please wipe up spills (even small ones!) immediately to prevent it from causing damage downstairs. 
- Don’t touch the A/V set-up or remove any cords/cables/adapters! We’ve worked hard to set up A/V and video streaming in our space. Please don’t remove any HD cables, adapters or unplug the set-up. Participants are responsible for providing their own adapters, unless given permission by staff.
- Do not go into locked offices or rooms. These offices belong to companies who work out of our space. Privacy and security are very important to them. Please only use rooms that are open. 
- DO NOT enter server rooms or electrical rooms. 
- Please help keep things clean by placing dirty dishes in the dishwasher and disposing of wrappers and trash.
