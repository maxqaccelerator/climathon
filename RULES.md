## Hack Rules
- Teams can be anywhere from two to five members. Remember, hacking with others is more fun!
- All teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the #Climathon.
- Use of open data and open-source libraries is mandatory. If you own a private dataset, please open it up!
- There will be no alcohol served or allowed on site. Zero tolerance.
- Just like Star Trek, we celebrate our differences. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. So harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.
- Consideration is golden. Please be mindful of others in the space. Our hosts at [Lighthouse Labs] may still be at their private coworking desks in the other side of the space. 
- Send out positive energy. Be a Jedi not a Sith. (not that there's anything wrong with being a Sith)
